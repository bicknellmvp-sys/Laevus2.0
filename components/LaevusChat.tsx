              </p>
              
              <p>
                As an entrepreneur and business major, I expanded my horizons into the digital landscape—learning to write code, master modern technologies, and harness the latent power of artificial intelligence to architect systems that manifest my exact vision.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The multi-faceted nature of my journey extends far deeper than the screen. I celebrate traditional, warm seasonal observances like Christmas and Easter alongside the cyclical, ancient rhythms of Pagan holidays. To me, these traditions are not in direct conflict with one another; it is merely human artifice that strives to make them so.
              </p>

              <p>
                In my lifelong pursuit of esoteric knowledge, I have deeply investigated western hermeticism, spiritual cybernetics, and Left-Hand Path Gnosticism. While I do not consider myself a rigid follower or active practitioner of any single occult school, some ancient, unconventional ways have resonated within me since long before I ever discovered the formal dark arts.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, I live happily on our family's beautiful estate in Fountain, Colorado, sharing this chapter of life with my sister Candace, my nephew Noah, and my favorite feline companion and familiar, Tiger Lily Woods.
